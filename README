John Conway's Life simulation, cellular automaton in color resembling 
one for the Cromemco Dazzler.  Births are shown in green, survival to the 
next generation in blue and deaths in red.  An editor is included with 
interesting preset shapes and random probabilities.  Statistics of 
heat, temperature, population and changes are provided in the console
window.  The program wants to be launched from a GUI console window, so
SDL can open a window to show the culture.  

Toggle between run and edit modes by hitting R (for Run) and E (for Edit).  
In Edit mode, use arrow keys to navigate, Insert and Delete keys to add 
and remove living cells.  Other letters insert shapes, C clears the grid.
Digit keys randomly sprinkle live cells around the grid with the probability 
indicated on the console window.  In Edit mode, the cursor is shown in
Yellow.  

Hit Q at any time, click on the X button at the top of the window to 
close it, or Ctrl C on the console window to quit and return to the command
line.  

SDL needs to be installed to compile with command
gcc L.c `sdl-config --cflags --libs `
